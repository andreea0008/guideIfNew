				<description>0. In this edition, we listen to a review 
				of a new film called 'The Hoax' which stars Richard 
				Gere. A hoax is a deception, a trick to make people 
				believe something is true when it is not. But as we hear, 
				the film is actually based on a true story - how, in 1971, 
				a writer called Clifford Irving tried to get a fake autobiography 
				of the superstar millionaire Howard Hughes published and make himself 
				extremely rich in the process..</description>
